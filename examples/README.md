# Demo corpus (`demo_corpus/`)

A tiny synthetic corpus (three one-page documents, ~40 words each) committed to
the repository so the pipeline demo runs fully offline and deterministically —
no API keys, no model downloads, no GPU.

## Layout

```
demo_corpus/
├── data/phase0/sample_manifest.csv            # example_id, doc_name, question, correct_answer, page_no
└── artifacts/phase0/ocr_text/
    ├── clean_threshold.txt                    # clean OCR page: "Zephyr compliance requires a threshold of 42%…"
    ├── noisy_threshold.txt                    # same facts, OCR-corrupted: "Z3phyr c0mpliance requires a thr3shold…"
    └── clean_accesslog.txt                    # clean yes/no page
```

This is the same layout the phase-0 pipeline expects for the real benchmark
(`data/phase0/sample_manifest.csv` + `artifacts/phase0/ocr_text/<id>.txt`),
so any `--project-root` pointing at this directory works with the real code.

## The story

The two threshold pages carry the same fact (`42%`). The corrupted page's
word-level noise (`Z3phyr`, `c0mpliance`, `thr3shold`) makes the evidence
untrustworthy: the quality gate flags `word_noise_alert`, the failure is
diagnosed as `word_level`, and recovery routes to OCR-text correction. Because
the offline profile disables ByT5, the correction is a *guarded skip* and the
pipeline answers from the flagged evidence with a measured confidence
(`support_score` 9 on the noisy page vs 10 on the clean page). No visual model
is invoked on any example — multimodal spend stays at zero.

## Running it

```bash
python scripts/demo/demo_run.py                # milestone trace over all three examples
```

The `faar-demo run-example` CLI accepts the same `--project-root` pointing at
this directory (it enables word-level ByT5 correction by default; on macOS
builds where faiss and torch OpenMP runtimes conflict, that path can crash —
use the demo script, or `run-benchmark --no-enable-byt5`, instead).
